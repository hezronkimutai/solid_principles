# Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

> High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.

The Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) emphasizes that software systems should depend on abstractions (interfaces), not concrete implementations. This decouples modules and promotes greater flexibility.

### Key Benefits:
- Reduces tight coupling
- Enhances code reusability and scalability
- Enables easier testing through dependency injection

### Examples:
- Injecting services via interfaces rather than hardcoding implementations
- Using dependency injection frameworks

Explore the examples to see how DIP creates systems that are robust and adaptable to change.
