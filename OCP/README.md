# Open-Closed Principle (OCP)

> Software entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification.

The Open-Closed Principle (OCP) promotes building software that allows behavior to be extended without modifying existing code. This enables safer evolution of systems as requirements change.

### Key Benefits:
- Reduces the risk of introducing bugs when adding new features
- Makes code more robust and flexible
- Supports better modular design

### Examples:
- Using interfaces or abstract classes to introduce new behaviors
- Applying strategy or decorator design patterns

Dive into the examples to understand how OCP makes your software scalable and future-proof.
