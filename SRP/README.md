# Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

> A class should have only one reason to change.

The Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) emphasizes that a class should do one thing and do it well. By limiting a class to a single responsibility, we make systems easier to understand, maintain, and extend.

### Key Benefits:
- Improves code maintainability
- Reduces the risk of unintended side effects
- Simplifies debugging and feature enhancements

### Examples:
- Splitting data processing and data storage into separate classes
- Separating business logic from presentation logic
