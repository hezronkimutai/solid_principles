# Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

> No client should be forced to depend on methods it does not use.

The Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) advises designing smaller, more specific interfaces rather than large, general-purpose ones. Clients should only be exposed to relevant methods.

### Key Benefits:
- Reduces unnecessary dependencies
- Simplifies testing and mocking
- Increases flexibility and modularity

### Examples:
- Splitting large interfaces into multiple smaller, focused interfaces
- Creating specialized service interfaces tailored to client needs

See the examples to understand how applying ISP leads to cleaner and more maintainable code.
