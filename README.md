# SOLID Principles in Software Design

Welcome to a professional reference guide on the SOLID principles â€” the cornerstone of writing scalable, maintainable, and robust object-oriented software systems.

This repository includes:
- Clear and concise explanations of each principle.
- Real-world scenarios illustrating why each principle matters.
- Practical code examples implemented across multiple programming languages.

Whether you're a student, engineer, or architect, this guide aims to bridge the gap between theory and practical application.

## What is SOLID?

SOLID is an acronym for five fundamental design principles in object-oriented programming:

- **S**ingle Responsibility Principle (SRP)
- **O**pen/Closed Principle (OCP)
- **L**iskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
- **I**nterface Segregation Principle (ISP)
- **D**ependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
